# Research

## Research Interests

I'm a fourth year graduate student at the University of Washington studying probability. My advisor is [Soumik Pal](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~soumik/). My research involves using discrete random trees and random graphs to understand continuum objects connected to other areas of probability, i.e. random matrix theory.
